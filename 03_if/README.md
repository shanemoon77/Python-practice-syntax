This repository contains notes and practice problems focused on Python conditional statements (if, elif, else), logical operators, and nested decision-making.
1. Conditional Basics
Simple if / elif / else usage.
Combining conditions with and, or, not.
Truthy and falsy values in Python.
2. Nested Conditions

3. Logical Expressions
Comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=).
Membership and identity operators (in, not in, is).
Conditional expressions (a if cond else b).
