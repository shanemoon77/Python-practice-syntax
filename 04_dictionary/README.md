# Dictionary & Set Practice Summary

This directory contains notes and coding exercises focused on Python dictionaries, sets, and nested data structures.  
It emphasizes understanding key–value relationships, data traversal, and efficient collection operations.

---

## 1. Dictionary Fundamentals
- Accessing, adding, and deleting key–value pairs.  
- Iterating with `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`.  
- Using `.get()` for safe lookups with default values.  
- Sorting and checking membership in dictionaries.  

---

## 2. Nested & Composite Structures
- Dictionaries inside lists and lists inside dictionaries.  
- Nested dictionaries for storing structured data.  
- Safely navigating and modifying multi-level data.  

---

## 3. Set Operations
- Creating sets with `set()` and curly braces `{}`.  
- Performing union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`).  
- Adding and removing elements with `.add()`, `.update()`, `.remove()`, and `.discard()`.  
- Understanding uniqueness and unordered properties of sets.  

---

## 4. Variable Manipulation
- Tuple and list unpacking: `a, b = b, a`.  
- Boolean logic and truthy/falsy evaluation.  
- Using compound assignments and concise expressions.

## Practice Problems
| No. | Function | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 01 | `filter_languages(data)` | Return names of users who prefer Python. |
| 02 | `calc_average(scores)` | Compute average scores across nested dictionaries. |
| 03 | `describe_pizza(order)` | Format and print pizza order details. |
| 04 | `reverse_dict(mapping)` | Swap keys and values in a dictionary. |
| 05 | `recommend_friends(name, network)` | Suggest "friends of friends". |
| 06 | `extract_strings(data)` | Recursively collect all string values from nested structures. |

---

## Study Focus
- Strengthen comprehension of Python’s mapping and set data types.  
- Practice data traversal and filtering logic.  
- Emphasize clean, readable, and functional dictionary/set manipulation.  
- Each problem includes example input, expected output, and implementation hints.
