# Python Practice Syntax

This repository contains my study records and practice problems for learning core Python syntax and data handling.  
Each directory focuses on a specific topic and contains detailed explanations, example code, and individual READMEs.

## Study Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a consistent record of Python syntax learning,  
with step-by-step progress from fundamentals to advanced practice using:
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
- Algorithm problem solving (Baekjoon)
- Data analysis and Kaggle projects (future sections)

## Notes

Each topic folder contains:
- `datas/` — text descriptions or prompts for practice problems  
- `solutions/` — corresponding code implementations  
- `README.md` — topic summaries and learning notes
